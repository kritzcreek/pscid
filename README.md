pscid
===

An editor agnostic minimal IDE for your shell. Think `pulp -w build` on steroids.

### Installation

Requires purescript >= v0.8.5 to be installed.

`npm i -g pscid`

### Usage

Start `pscid` in a terminal in the root folder of your project.

pscid will show you errors and warnings (one at a time) whenever you save a PureScript source file. This makes for a nice iterative workflow.

Type `b` inside `pscid`'s terminal window to build your project. This looks up the `build` script inside your package.json and failing to find that will run `pulp build`.

Type `t` inside `pscid`'s terminal window to test your project. As with building this looks up the `test` script in package.json first, and falls back to `pulp test` otherwise.

Type `q` to quit pscid.

### Demo

### Options
  - `-p` The port to use. Defaults to 4243
  - `--include -I <dir;dir;...>`  Additional directories for PureScript source files, separated by `;`
  - `--test` Runs your tests after every successful rebuild
